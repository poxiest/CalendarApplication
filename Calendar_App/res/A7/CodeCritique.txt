Bad

1) All the command classes in commands package have switch cases based on the input length to process different kind of request. This will be a problem when two different commands have same length. further increasing the conditional cases.

2) Current code the controller get the current active calendar and calls each operation, letting controller do more work other than the actual work. Introduction of a facade design pattern to act a bridge between the controller and calendar model would have an option to eliminate the additional work the calendar application is performing.

3) The printing style of events in the CLI is formatted from the Model. This is not the work of a model to perform. View is responsible for this. This limits viewing events in different formats later.

4) IViewEvents, IViewRecurringEvent, IViewRecurringUntilEvent, IViewRecurringSequenceEvent are interfaces with getters and setters to view events in the GUI. 8 different interfaces and classes are used just for this increasing confusion and needs to changes if there is a new type of event required.

5) View class has a private class FeatureActionListener which is responsible for action listeners. action performed has a list of action commands with the corresponding actions. All the cases are in a switch case, instead it could have been in a Map or in separate classes.


Good
1) Events have been represented in multiple classes making the best use of inheritance and code reuse. Interfaces have also been nicely designed such that it follows Interface Segregation Principles.

2) GUI View and controller are independent following General Command Callbacks, allowing the user to add a different kind of view if required.
