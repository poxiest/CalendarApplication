question regarding edit events
edit events <property> <eventName> from <dateStringTtimeString> with <NewPropertyValue>
from what I understand from @404, edit events is used to edit only the recurring events, and not the single events. So in this case, should we edit all the recurring events with the given event name whose start time is after the give datetime?

ans : All events starting at the given timestamp. Not all events after the given timestamp.

For example:
Event1: 2025/03/06 10:00–11:00
Event2: 2025/03/06 11:00–12:00
Since Event2 starts exactly when Event1 ends, does this count as a conflict, or are adjacent events considered non-conflicting?

ans : It's not a conflict, since it is possible to be present at both events.

Hi! I have a couple of questions regarding the headless mode.
1. What happens if exit is in the middle? Do all commands after it gets ignored?

2. What happens if the last command is not exit? Do we throw an exception or what?

ans : Yes for 1.

      For 2, think about it. The spec says the last command must be exit.

change the controller back to headless and

The conflict section states "The calendar must decline to create an event if the user has explicitly asked it to automatically decline event creation in case of a conflict. If the user hasn't opted for automatic declination then the event is created and all conflicting events are preserved." For recurring events the default behavior is to reject conflicting recurring events. But that is not the case for single events.

Hi I am not the student asking this question, but I think what he/she meant was that, for below specific command:
"create event --autoDecline <eventName> from <dateStringTtimeString> to <dateStringTtimeString> repeats <weekdays> until <dateStringTtimeString>"

There is no point in supporting user to input a --autoDecline flag, because whether or not the user types that flag, the behavior is the same: since we are trying to add a recurring event, we always decline to add it when it conflicts with an existing event.

I agree for recurring events the flag is extraneous. But that is fine since its optional.

If you are talking about the following command:
edit events <property> <eventName> from <dateStringTtimeString> with <NewPropertyValue>
Changes the property (e.g., name) of all events starting at a specific date/time and have the same event name.
It would function like the Google Calendar edit recurring event - this and following events function, where events prior to that date are not changed.
