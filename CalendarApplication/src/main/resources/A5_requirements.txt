- support multiple calendars
- calendars should have unique names
- default timezone to EST
- AUTO DECLINE is true always
- conflict works on create, edit and copying event from one
calendar to another
- edit events - edit both single and recurring events
- copy calendar events - should adjust for the new calendar's timezone
- make sure about conflict
- refactor exporter
- try move io to controller
- write readme for all the changes with justification
- write testcases and check mutation
- create a jar file for submission
- use DTO for printing

- check a4 results and make the changes in a5

- what are the possible extensions and how feasible.
based on that see if we can refactor our code more.
- use DTO wherever required (check after a4 grading)
